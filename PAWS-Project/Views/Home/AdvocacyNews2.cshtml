            PAWS is dedicated to promoting the welfare of animals through strategic partnerships with local, state, and federal lawmakers.
            Our mission is to ensure that animals are treated with the respect and care they deserve, and we work tirelessly to advocate for stronger laws and policies that protect them.
            By collaborating with legislators, we aim to create lasting change that will improve the lives of animals for generations to come.
